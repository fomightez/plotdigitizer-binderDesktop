# plotdigitizer-binderDesktop
Python-based PlotDigitizer working alongside Qt on desktop in sessions served via MyBinder.org

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/plotdigitizer-binderDesktop/HEAD?urlpath=desktop)

-------------------

This is meant to accompany [plotdigitizer-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/plotdigitizer-binder) to add a GUI to locate points. Because it is a little clunky, I'm keeping most of the actual use at [plotdigitizer-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/plotdigitizer-binder); however, you should be able to copy the notebook(s) from there and place them in the root of the cloned PlotDigitizer repo and they'll work here.

Initial technical details:

Started with [Spyder that works in Linux desktop via MyBinder from here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/binder-environments/tree/spyder-stable) and added plotdigitzer and opencv that seeemed needed to make plotdigitizer work [here](https://github.com/fomightez/plotdigitizer-binder).
